# ML-Playground
This repo acts as a dynamic portfolio for my experiences with machine learning, and AI throughout my studies.

Working with different machine learning algorithms to practice, learn, and expand understanding. These algorithms are intended to be used as intermediate processes within larger systems.

### Methods That I have Learned in Class
- K means
- MLP (Multi-layer perceptrons)
- Decision trees

### KMeans Class
- K means algorithm
- Works by assiging the data point to the closest cluster, adjusting the cluster means and repeating until the points have converged

### ImageDetector
- Utilizes the Pytorch torchvision framework for image classification
- Working algorithm for object detection also within the ImageDetector folder
- Currently working algorithm that can identify what object is in an image
- Lists the top k classes and their probability
- Located within the ImageDetection folder
