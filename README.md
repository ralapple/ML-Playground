# ML Playground
Welcome!
My name is Ray, and I am currently a computer science junior at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
Throughout my studies I have found deep interest in machine learning, specifically, training my own models, applying models to real applications, 
and just messing around with the technology.
This repository acts like a giant folder for all of my projects I work on in classes, and in my own free time.

I will try to include a README in each of the directories explaining what it is about and how it works. 
Most of these that require training were first developed on Google Colab, for the GPU processing power, and then moved to this repo for my personal storage.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
