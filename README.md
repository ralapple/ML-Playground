# ML-Training
This repo acts as a dynamic portfolio for my experiences with machine learning, and AI throughout my studies.

Working with different machine learning algorithms to practice, learn, and expand understanding. 

### Methods That I have Learned in Class
- K means
- MLP (Multi-layer perceptrons)
- Decision trees

# KMeans Class
- K means algorithm
- Works by assiging the data point to the closest cluster, adjusting the cluster means and repeating until the points have converged

# Working on an image object detection program
- Goal is to identify the object, bound it by a box, and show the percentage certainty
- This can be used later as an intermediate process in a larger program
